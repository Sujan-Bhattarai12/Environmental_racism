## Instructions

1. **R Script**: The main analysis script can be found in the `R/` folder named `script.R`.
2. **Data**: Raw data is stored in the `data/` folder.
   - `EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb/`: EJScreen data.
   - `gbif-birds-LA/`: Bird observations data.
   - ...

## Results and Findings

### Part 1: Data Exploration

- Map of wastewater discharge in Los Angeles County.
- Percentage of low-income population in census block groups.
- Census block groups with high air pollution and low Superfund proximity.
- Mapping of HOLC grade designations for Los Angeles.

### Part 2: Data Analysis and Decision Making

- Bird observations from 2022 within HOLC grades.
- Percent of bird observations within each redlining category.
- Visualization of redlining areas and bird diversity index averages.

## Recommendations

- The analysis suggests a strong correlation between historical redlining and current environmental issues.
- Policy makers should consider biodiversity implications when planning conservation efforts in low-graded areas.
- The project challenges the assumption that low-graded areas have low species diversity.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by research studies and datasets from various sources.
- Special thanks to the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond for the Mapping Inequality project.
